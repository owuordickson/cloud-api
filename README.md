## Requirements

You will be required to install **Docker**

## Installation

1. Download package

2. Use a command line program with the local package:

``` shell
$docker-compose up
```

## Usage

Launch your *Browser* and go to: <http://localhost:8080>

**NB:** a sample *IoT* data set provided in ```sample_data```, follow the steps to populate your database
